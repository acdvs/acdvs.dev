      <p>
        I&apos;m a full stack software engineer with a passion for building pixel-perfect
        fully accessible UIs, powerful APIs, and performant microservices. I&apos;ve led
        the planning, design, and execution of numerous impactful features in
        client-facing roles, improving efficiency by up to five times and greatly
        simplifying complex processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I excel in rapidly developing SPAs and MPAs with React, TypeScript, and Next.js,
        utilizing SSR where possible for minimal TTFB and client bandwidth. I have
        experience with a variety of back end technologies -- namely Node.js for
        single-language projects, Golang (Go) for fast APIs, and Rust for
        computation-intensive WebAssembly solutions.
