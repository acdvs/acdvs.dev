      <p>
        I&apos;ve worked with TypeScript, React, and Next.js for my entire career. As
        someone who has studied design, I&apos;m able to take products and features from
        start to finish entirely on my own with a natural sense of component design and
        composition that fits each use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the front end, I have experience with a wide range of back end
        languages, databases, and other systems. I commonly use Go for building robust
        APIs, Rust for WebAssembly, and various AWS services like S3, EC2, Lambda, and API
        Gateway.
